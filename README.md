bachelorAssignment: Estimation of Rainfall by Integrating a Satellite-Based Algorithm and Rain Gauge Networks

## Abstract
The spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is very important for scientific uses and human beingâ€™s life [1]. The main goal of this study is to automate the process of producing precipitation estimates, based on gauge precipitation observation and satellite precipitation estimates. The scripts use ILWI-Python extensions (ilwis4). The algorithm applied in this study is Combined Scheme (CoSch) technique [1]. In order to generalize the script, two cases have been implemented: Latin America case and Africa case. The scripts and the precipitation estimation results produced in both cases are very useful for future work. 

Keywords: combined scheme, additive bias correction, ratio bias correction

## Objective
The goal of this study is to develop scripts that automate and execute the Combined Scheme technique using ILWI-Python extensions.

## State of art
1) What are the advantages and disadvantage of gauge-based rainfall observation and satellite-based rainfall estimation?

2) What is the best merging technique? 
Combined scheme (CoSch) technique consistently presents the best performance, among all the five merging techniques [1]. Combined scheme technique combines two approaches (additive bias correction and ratio bias correction) into a single method to remove the bias of the satellite estimates [3]. If the precipitation value corrected by additive bias correction (ADD) is closer to the gauge-based observation than the value corrected by ratio bias correction (ADD), then the ADD-corrected rainfall value is chosen [1]. Vice versa.
