## Abstract
The spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is very important for scientific uses and human beingâ€™s life [1]. The main goal of this study is to automate the process of producing precipitation estimates, based on gauge precipitation observation and satellite precipitation estimates. The scripts use ILWI-Python extensions (ilwis4). The algorithm applied in this study is Combined Scheme (CoSch) technique [1]. In order to generalize the script, two cases have been implemented: Latin America case and Africa case. The scripts and the precipitation estimation results produced in both cases are very useful for future work. 

## Keywords
  satellite-based rainfall estimation, gauge-based rainfall observation, combined scheme, additive bias correction, ratio bias correction

## Objective
The goal of this study is to develop scripts that automate and execute the Combined Scheme technique using ILWI-Python extensions.

## State of art

    The table shows a comparison between gauge-based rainfall observation and satellite-based rainfall estimation on their reliability and area coverage

2) What is the best merging technique? 
    Combined scheme (CoSch) technique consistently presents the best performance, among all the five merging techniques [1]. Combined scheme technique combines two approaches (additive bias correction and ratio bias correction) into a single method to remove the bias of the satellite estimates [3]. If the precipitation value corrected by additive bias correction (ADD) is closer to the gauge-based observation than the value corrected by ratio bias correction (ADD), then the ADD-corrected rainfall value is chosen [1]. Vice versa.
